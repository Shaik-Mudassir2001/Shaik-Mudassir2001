Hi, I’m Shaik Mudassir
I am a student at the Lords Institute of Engineering and Technology in Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science.
I am passionate about pursuing my major in Computer Science. 
My goal is to get a job in the Full Stack Development field after graduating. 
I enjoy solving technical problems, researching and developing new technologies, designing software applications for different platforms. 
I am also interested in pursuing degree programs in Computer Science. 
I enjoy meeting people and working with them in a team environment. 
I am a quick learner with a fun, outgoing personality. 
In addition, I excel in my ability to work under pressure and handle stressful situations very well.

These skills that I have will be a benefit for any software company.
